The birth of the cool
=====================
This year’s [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) has raised the excitement level in the vector dojo because the puzzles are particularly susceptible to vector solutions. 

We nod to code golfers who seek the shortest solutions, and to others who pursue the fastest. But in the dojo we seek the most ‘vector-ish’ solutions. That’s admittedly a bit vague, because it is at bottom an aesthetic criterion – often pronounced “cool”.

Feel free to chime in with comments and alternatives: what follows is unlikely to be the last word in cool.
