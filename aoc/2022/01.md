# Day 1: Calorie Counting


> Santa’s reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of magical energy to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of star fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.

## Ingestion

```q
inp: read0`:input/01.txt
loads: sum each{(0,where null x)_ x}"I"$inp
```

Above, `read0` returns a list of strings that [Tok](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/tok) interprets as integers. 
Note that Tok iterates implicitly through the strings; no Each is needed. 

Cillian found a way to avoid the `sum`.

```q
value each"++"vs"+"sv inp
```

This is cunning. He uses `"+"` to join the strings, which leaves `"++"` separating the records, which he can then evaluate with `value each`.

```q
q)"+"sv read0 `:test/01.txt
"1000+2000+3000++4000++5000+6000++7000+8000+9000++10000"
q)"++"vs"+"sv read0 `:test/01.txt
"1000+2000+3000"
"4000"
"5000+6000"
"7000+8000+9000"
"10000"
```

Nick Psaris read the input in binary and cast to character

```q
q)"\n\n"vs"c"$read1 `:test/01.txt
"1000\n2000\n3000"
"4000"
"5000\n6000"
"7000\n8000\n9000"
"10000"
```

and used `get` (a synonym of `value`) to evaluate.

```q
loads:(sum get::) each "\n\n"vs"c"$read1 `:test/01.txt
```

Sean Ang used string search-and-replace to wrangle the input.

```q
q)ssr[;"  ";";sum "]" "sv read0 `:test/01.txt
"1000 2000 3000;sum 4000;sum 5000 6000;sum 7000 8000 9000;sum 10000"
q)value {"(sum ",x,")"} ssr[;"  ";";sum "]" "sv read0 `:test/01.txt
6000 4000 11000 24000 10000
```

### Cillian’s straight vector ingestion

A ‘straight’ vector solution avoids partitioning vectors into lists of lists.
Because q handles vectors efficiently, straight-vector solutions are often very fast.

Cillian found one using sorts and Match Each Prior (`~':`).

```q
q)show s:sums"J"$read0`:test/01.txt
1000 3000 6000 6000 10000 10000 15000 21000 21000 28000 36000 45000 45000 55000
q)(~':)s
00010100100010b
q)s*(~':)s
0 0 0 6000 0 10000 0 0 21000 0 0 0 45000 0
q)desc deltas asc s*(~':)s
24000 11000 6000 4000 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

```q
loads:desc deltas asc s*(~':)s:sums"J"$read0`:test/01.txt
```

And we are happy to ignore the trailing zeroes. 

Once the loads have been calculated, the rest is trivial.


## Solutions

```q
max loads         /part 1
sum 3#desc loads  /part 2
```

Or, since we have to sort for Part 2 anyway, we can lose the `max`.


```q
(first;sum 3#::)@\:desc loads
```
