Advent of q 2022
================

[Eric Wastl](http://was.tl)’s annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) (AoC) competition always engages some veteran q programmers. (In fact Arthur Whitney studies AoC solutions for ways to improve the design of k.) Their ingenious and wonderfully terse solutions repay study, but are mostly shared on private forums. 

Here are test and input files for the 2022 AoC puzzles, and working solutions, together with articles analysing and comparing them.
