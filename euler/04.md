# 4. Largest palindromic product

## Problem

https://projecteuler.net/problem=4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. 
The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009=91×99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.


## Solution

Our candidates are the products of the unique pairs of 3-digit numbers:

```q
c:prd each distinct asc each {x cross x} 100+ til 1000-100  / candidate products
ip:{x~reverse x}                                            / is palindrome?
max c where ip each string c
```


## Optimisation

### Test

The palindrome test is famous in k (`{x~|x}`) and only slightly longer in q: `{x~reverse x}`.

Jonathan Kane [proposes](https://community.kx.com/t5/kdb-and-q/Q-For-Problems-Episode-4/td-p/13254) an optimisation for this case: reverse the string and Tok to long, then compare the original number – Equals on longs is faster than Match on strings.
But is the time saved more than the Tok takes? 

```q
q)/ atom
q)\ts:10000 {x~reverse x} string 905509      / classic
4 1280
q)\ts:10000 {x="J"$reverse string x} 905509  / variant
4 1488

q)/ vector
q)p:10000?1000000
q)\ts:100 {x~reverse x}each string p         / classic
229 1049152
q)\ts:100 p="J"$reverse each string p        / variant
147 1049200
```

Yes! No interesting difference testing an atom, but the variant is faster with a vector.
The difference is probably shared between Equals on longs being faster than Match on strings, and `string` being faster than `string each`.


### Search

But there is no need to test every candidate. 
When we have found the highest palindrome we can stop.
We can loop through the products in descending order:

```q
i:count C:asc c
while[not ip string C i-:1;]
C i
```

The cost of the sort and the explicit loop is repaid by not having to cast the entire list to strings and test each one. 

Testing atoms, we stay with the classic test. 

```q
q)ipv:{x~'"J"$reverse each string x}  / vector test
q)\ts max c where ipv c
107 32303200
q)\ts i:count C:asc c; while[not ip string C i-:1;]; C i
10 12584304
```

A functional version of the above:

```q
.[@] ({not ip string x y}.) @[;1;-1+]/ (asc c;count[c]-1)
```

Note the use of `@[;1;-1+]/` to decrement the index, and `.[@]` to resolve the result.


## Generalisation

From this we can see a general form for finding the last item that passes a test:

```q
lastitem:{[test;list].[@] ({x y z}[test].) @[;1;-1+]/ (list;-1+count list)}
lastitem[not ip string@] asc c
```
