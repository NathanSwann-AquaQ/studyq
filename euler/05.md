# 5. Smallest multiple

https://projecteuler.net/problem=5

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


# Solve

Start by reproducing the example.
10 is the smallest candidate. 
Start with 10 and keep incrementing; as long as any `mod 1+til 10` 

A while-loop will do the job.

```q
q)f:1+til 10; i:10; while[any i mod f; i+:1]; i
2520
```

We can write the same in functional form using the [While form of the Over iterator](https://code.kx.com/q/ref/accumulators/#while), with a composition as the truth function.

```q
q)(any mod[;1+til 10]@) (1+)/10
2520
```

## Improve

But we *don’t* need to test every number. 
A number evenly divisible by `1+til 10` must be evenly divisible by each of the primes in that list, i.e. `2 3 5 7`, and must therefore be divisible by their product `P`.
We can start with `P`, and test multiples of it. 

```q
q)(any mod[;1+til 10]@) (P+)/P:prd 2 3 5 7
2520

q)\ts:100 (any mod[;1+til 10]@) (1+)/10
239 2064
q)\ts:100 (any mod[;1+til 10]@) (P+)/P:prd 2 3 5 7
1 2848
```

With the numbers from 1 to 20, `P` becomes 9699690, and the search takes very little longer.

```q
q)\ts:100 (any mod[;1+til 20]@) (P+)/P:prd 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19
3 3168
```

## Generalise

For a number `N` we need the primes below it. 
Enter [Eratosthenes’ Sieve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).

![Sieve of Eratosthenes](Sieve_of_Eratosthenes_animation.svg)

```q
kc:{(1#2;0b,1_x#10b)}                                             / (known primes; flag candidates)
snp:{(x,n;y&count[y]#i<>til n:1+i:y?1b)}.                         / sieve next prime
es:raze@[;1;1+where@] {{x>last first y}[floor sqrt x] snp/kc x}@  / Eratosthenes' sieve
```

```q
q){(any mod[;1+til x]@) (P+)/P:prd es x}10
2520
```
